Welcome to the CyberDataSchema_StorageSolutions repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive hub for managing and sharing a variety of data storage format creation scripts. These scripts are specifically designed to be compatible with the [Cyber Data Schema](https://github.com/stellatechnologies/CyberDataSchema), facilitating the integration and deployment of standardized data storage solutions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to offer a diverse set of scripts that aid in the creation of data storage formats. These scripts ensure compatibility with the evolving standards of the Cyber Data Schema, supporting a broad range of applications in cybersecurity and data management.
